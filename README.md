## Hello! 
I spent way too long editing all of the colors for the livesplit layout, so it would be pretty cool if you checked that out.
But besides that, this is where I'll be updating the settings for the autosplitter, as well as adding images I use for it on the way.
If you have any issues with the autosplitter, opening an issue request would be much appreciated.
